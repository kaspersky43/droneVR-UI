This week we improved the movement of the character by implementing gestures to move the operator in the direction that he's looking, along with a freeze gesture to stop movement. 

We also collected some mock data using the OptiTrack cameras by manually moving a drone in the lab. For next week, we're going to feed that into Unreal Engine to get the drones moving in the scene.
