This week our group primarily worked on the preparation of our midterm presentation and presented it to the CS faculty.

Our presentation primarily focused on detailing a concept design of the heads up display for our virtual reality scene, and describing how the technologies we're using will work together.

Next week we will begin creating the HUD in UnrealEngine.
