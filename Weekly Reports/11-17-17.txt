Today we have resolved the hardware connection issues with modifying the wire positions in the environment and modified the Natnet software package to be able to read the positions of the drones rather than the angles per frame to mark and calibrate the positions of the droneWe also worked further on the server and client code:The server now has an event loop which checks for incoming .json data, looks for the intended client and forwards the data to the appropriate client.The client is being set up to receive this data and forward it onward to the appropriate drone.
