Today, we have checked on the status of the hardwares of the lab and found the problems not letting the cameras to fully work, so we are waiting on Dr. Gururajan's assistance for resolving the problems. We tried to figure out how to interpret the coordianates raw data from the IR sensors and found a server/client program that was used in the lab connected to the position PC that is connected to the IR cameras. We are also expecting the former team members to come and demonstrate and give us the full access to the related programs used for the past project and we decided we go over the documentations to the full extent. Minor points of improvements for the performance of cameras and the MATLAB codebase were suggested. 

Built a basic server and client system with text communication. Can connect and keep track of multiple clients.
