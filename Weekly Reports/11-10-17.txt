Logan and Kyle modified our UDPClient to intercept the json messages moving from the VR system and direct them to the UDPServer. We wrote a handler function to manage the messages and look for some header data containing the id of the drone the message is intended for. I wrote a function to send the message to the drone, but our drone has gone missing so I can really test it....
